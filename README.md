### WiFi Weather Station Description
App & Device can be used to monitor weather conditions in agricultural, industrial or commercial applications and can be expanded to monitor numerous other types of data according to the need of the client, market and by sensors available. 

Project is to measure the temperature and humidity in real time with sensors and then transmit the data wirelessly via WiFi to a MySQL, MongoDB or a Cloud based database (like THINGSPEAK, cloud based storage for iot devices) and then display the data with various web technologies in a website interface.


----

### Features to have:
- MySQL, MongoDB or a Cloud based data logging of temperature & humidity via WiFi
- Results viewable by charts, tables and/or graphs in a website interface
- Real time  temperature and humidity monitoring as polled from sensor 
- Weather forcasting provided by 3rd party source by API
- Battery powered, portable device


----

### Features to create if time or for future uses:
- data logging of additional sensors (for Agricultural, industrial or commercial Applications)
- Device location via GPS
- Twitter alerts - low/high temperature or humidity, low battery level, ect...
- Solar powered battery source
